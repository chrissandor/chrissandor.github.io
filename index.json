To add and arrange virtual objects in HAR, users must manipulate 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the virtual object, namely: position (3) and orientation (3). However, it is difficult to manipulate all DoFs with the two-dimensional display of the handheld device. We present SlidAR+, a method for controlling the position and orientation of objects in HAR. SlidAR+ is an extension of SlidAR [1], a technique that allows users to control the position of a virtual object by manipulating only 1 DoF. We use the direction of gravity as a constraint to improve the user's control and reduce the time it takes to adjust the orientation. Upon comparing it with a state-of-the-art object manipulation method, using SlidAR+, user were able to complete the tasks faster under our expected conditions and were also preferred by most participants.","tags":["Gravity","Handheld augmented reality","Object manipulation"],"title":"SlidAR+: Gravity-Aware 3D Object Manipulation for Handheld Augmented Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Akiyama","Goshiro Yamamoto","Toshiyuki Amano","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"0f27148259071cbc04308baad2bd08f2","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/akiyama-2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T05:44:44.36333Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akiyama-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel method for robustly estimating reflectance even in a dynamically changing light environment. To control the appearance of an object by using a projector-camera system, appropriate reflectance estimation is vital to the creation of an appropriate projection image. Most conventional estimation methods have assumed a static light condition although, in practice, the appearance is affected not only by the reflectance but also by the environmental light. In a dynamically changing light environment, conventional methods must be capable of applying calibrations every time the conditions change. Our method is based on a concept of creating two different light conditions by switching the projection at a rate that is higher than what the human eye can perceive, capturing images of a target object separately under each condition. Our method simultaneously estimates the reflectance and environmental light by using a pair of images acquired under two conditions. We implemented a projector-camera system that switches the projection on and off at 120 Hz. We conducted two experiments to confirm the robustness when changing the brightness and the color saturation of the environmental light, respectively. The results indicated our method is capable of robustly estimating the reflectance under practical indoor lighting conditions.","tags":["Appearance manipulation","environmental light","projector-camera system","reflectance estimation","spatial augmented reality"],"title":"Robust Reflectance Estimation for Projection-Based Appearance Control in a Dynamic Light Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hing Chao","Jeffrey Shaw","Ricky Lau","Daniel Eckhoff","Jacopo Penso"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630054394,"objectID":"b19ed311895b3ec9bb56fb414c400c51","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/chao-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-27T08:53:09.326173Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chao-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"3D Animation with Scientific Annotation - Geometric Representations of Italian Martial Arts (Two Swords)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Eckhoff","Alvaro Cassinelli","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"980972bbe7da3137db50f970bab37756","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/eckhoff-2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-10T05:44:44.364587Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eckhoff-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"[DC] Psychophysical Effects of Augmented Reality Experiences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayson Haebich","Christian Sandor","Alvaro Cassinelli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d276c081bffb970a60201dba65f1aead","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/haebich-2021-classifying/","publishdate":"2021-03-17T06:39:50.368035Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haebich-2021-classifying/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Classifying Cycling Hazards in Egocentric Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yutaka Tokuda","Deepak Ranjan Sahoo","Matt Jones","Sriram Subramanian","Anusha Withana"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"64ebc9e29e32ae7f25a4fdd7da4f9240","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/10-1145-3430524-3440654/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T03:00:13.2639Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10-1145-3430524-3440654/","section":"publication","summary":" We present Flowcuits, a DIY fabrication method to prototype tangible, interactive and functional electrical components by manipulating liquid metals.

PTSD has not only high prevalence but also high lethality, which is accompanied by multiple physical and mental comorbidities as well as strong suicidal tendencies [5]-[7]. This doctoral research aims to contribute to the development of PTSD treatment by investigating the possibility of adopting Augmented Reality (AR) narrative in treating PTSD. This four-year research project consists of three steps. In the first stage of research, we will conduct a comparative study between AR and VR narratives with healthy participants to verify whether AR narratives work better in eliciting the emotional engagement of the participants than VR narratives. In the second stage, we will create a system that integrates AR narratives with prolonged exposure (PE) treatment and experiment it with PTSD patients to verify its treatment efficacy. In the final stage, a semi-Automatic and patient-Authored AR system is expected to be achieved, through which the patients can design their own exposure environment via voice input. This project will provide valuable experimental samples and scientific analysis for the research of psychotherapy, narrative studies, and AR application.","tags":["Augmented Reality","Narrative Exposure","Patient-Authored AR narrative","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","Prolong Exposure"],"title":"Augmented Reality Narratives for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Eckhoff","Alvaro Cassinelli","Tuo Liu","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract Can interactive Augmented Reality (AR) experiences induce involuntary sensations through additional modalities?

A projector can be used to control light reflected from an object, where the reflected light depends not only on the projection but also on the reflectance and environmental light. Because the resulting colors are affected by the reflectance and environmental light, the presentable color range of a projector is limited. The purpose of this work is to broaden this limited range by focusing on the perceived colors. Although our eyes capture reflected light to perceive the colors of an object, the colors perceived by humans are not always the same as the actual colors, and there are often significant differences between them because of the human visual system. To overcome the limitations of a projector based on human perception, we intentionally generate this difference by inducing a visual illusion, namely, color constancy. In this work, we designed an algorithm to determine the projected colors for presenting the desired colors perceptually by employing a color constancy effect. In addition, we conducted a user study and confirmed that our algorithm can (1) create a misperception regarding the color of illumination, (2) broaden the presentable color range of a projector, and (3) shift the perceptual colors in the desirable direction.","tags":["Color constancy","Color perception","Projector–camera system","Spatial augmented reality"],"title":"Illusory light: Perceptual appearance control using a projection-induced illusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pui Chung Wong","Kening Zhu","Xing-Dong Yang","Hongbo Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"c1dc6b593d1b6d7126f614269f070fd6","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/pui-chung-chi-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-16T10:01:44.941659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pui-chung-chi-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring Eyes-Free Bezel-Initiated Swipe on Round Smartwatches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuanyu Wang (Shawn)","Yang Wang","Yan Shi","Weizhan Zhang","Qinghua Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"a02a490c4acd82384df3e396504968af","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/wang-acm-2020/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T05:39:33.774963Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-acm-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"AvatarMeeting: An Augmented Reality Remote Interaction System With Personalized Avatars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

In this paper, we create HoloRoyale, the first large scale high fidelity (LSHF) CAR experience. We do this by first exploring the LSHF CAR design space, drawing on technical implementations and design aspects from AR and video games. We then create and implement a software architecture that improves the accuracy of synchronized poses between multiple users. Finally, we apply our target experience and technical implementation to the explored design space. A core design component of HoloRoyale is the use of visual repellers as crowd control elements to guide players away from undesired areas. To evaluate the effectiveness of the employed visual repellers in a LSHF CAR context we conducted a user study, deploying HoloRoyale in a 12.500 m2 area. The results from the user study suggest that visual repellers are effective crowd control elements that do not significantly impact the user’s overall immersion. Overall our main contribution is the exploration of a design space, discussing several means to address the challenges of LSHF CAR, the creation of a system capable of LSHF CAR interactions along with an experience that has been fitted to the design space, and an indepth study that verifies a key design aspect for LSHF CAR. As such, our work is the first to explore the domain of LSHF CAR and provides insight into designing experiences in other AR domains.","tags":["Augmented reality","Game design","High fidelity","Large scale interaction"],"title":"Towards large scale high fidelity collaborative augmented reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Shaw","Theo Botschuiver","Larry Abel","Joseph Chan","Daniel Eckhoff","John Choy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630054394,"objectID":"43ace3f2794e34e86c3a95636d34593e","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/shaw-2019/","publishdate":"2021-08-27T08:53:14.340439Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shaw-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In the late 1970s, Jeffrey Shaw and his Eventstructure Research Group partner Theo Botschuijver embarked on a series of computer graphic and augmented reality experiments that were inspired by two technologies: first, an age-old illusion technique called ‘Pepper’s Ghost’ that dates back to the 16th century—a technique that uses a see-through mirror to create ‘ghost’ images that seemingly float in space; second, the pioneering virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD) invented by Ivan Sutherland in 1968, which he called the ‘Sword of Damocles’. Their first artwork that resulted from their joint research was “Virtual Sculptures” in 1981. It utilised an Apple II computer to create the 3D computer graphic imagery, a tripod mounted CRT monitor fitted with a Fresnel lens and see-through mirror and an interactive design that allowed the viewer to rotate and tilt this monitor so as to discover animated computer-generated virtual objects floating about at different locations in the physical exhibition space. This artful apparatus prefigured the augmented reality (AR) systems that were introduced into the market some twenty years later and which are currently a fast-developing industry.While this artwork has recently entered the collection of the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, the exhibition at WYSIWYG will be the first public showing of its re-make since the original no longer exists. The reconstruction of the CRT monitor, Fresnel lens, see-through mirror and tripod assembly are as faithful to the original as possible. Similarly, the appearance of the animated computer graphic images (simple low resolution wireframe objects) is also replicated, but now using a newly programmed PC rather than the obsolete Apple II computer and the subLOGIC A2-3D1 software that ran the original.For its exhibition at WYSIWYG, this artwork is being presented with its original content in a newly conceived installation format that is locally contextualised. The interactive apparatus is positioned at the centre of a large 7m diameter all-encompassing panoramic photograph, so that its virtual AR objects can be seen to be floating within the scenery of that photograph. The Hong Kong photographer John Choy was commissioned to make a black and white panoramic photograph of Hong Kong’s Central district for this purpose. Choy deploys an aesthetic strategy he developed in earlier panoramic photos taken of Hong Kong, wherein this urban landscape is completely devoid of people. In the context of the installation at Osage, this means that only the artwork’s virtual objects now occupy Central’s eerily vacant environment.","tags":[],"title":"Virtual Sculptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheer Xu","Pui Chung Wong","Jun Gong","Te-Yen Wu","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Xiaojun Bi","Jürgen Steimle","Hongbo Fu","Kening Zhu","Xing-Dong Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"0a7cd659b943c472211cdf6286b4e7c6","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/pui-chung-acm-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-16T10:01:44.943259Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pui-chung-acm-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"TipText: Eyes-Free Text Entry on a Fingertip Keyboard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Akiyama","Goshiro Yamamoto","Toshiyuki Amano","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"9461714e8221c7f4927915328b64adc8","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/akiyama-robust-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.865399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akiyama-robust-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel method that robustly estimates the reﬂectance, even in an environment with dynamically changing light. To control the appearance of an object by using a projector–camera system, an appropriate estimate of the object’s reﬂectance is vital to the creation of an appropriate projection image. Most conventional estimation methods assume static light conditions; however, in practice, the appearance is affected by both the reﬂectance and environmental light. In an environment with dynamically changing light, conventional reﬂectance estimation methods require calibration every time the conditions change. In contrast, our method requires no additional calibration because it simultaneously estimates both the reﬂectance and environmental light. Our method is based on the concept of creating two different light conditions by switching the projection at a rate higher than that perceived by the human eye and captures the images of a target object separately under each condition. The reﬂectance and environmental light are then simultaneously estimated by using the pair of images acquired under these two conditions. We implemented a projector–camera system that switches the projection on and off at 120 Hz. Experiments conﬁrm the robustness of our method when changing the environmental light. Further, our method can robustly estimate the reﬂectance under practical indoor lighting conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Reflectance Estimation for Projection-Based Appearance Control in a Dynamic Light Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Eckhoff","Alvaro Cassinelli","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":" We will investigate perceptual and cognitive responses of users of several extreme Augmented Reality experiences on an Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display (a).

One of the important hand functions that deteriorate over time is the ability to control finger force exertion, due to the gradual decrease in finger muscle strength as people age. Previous studies have shown that with proper training, it is possible to regain finger strength. However, when designing training systems for finger force control, visualization of the finger forces plays an important role in its effectiveness. In this paper, we describe the development of the augmented reality pressing and evaluation system (AR-PETS), an augmented reality based prototype system for finger force control training. We discuss the development of the system, as well as the design considerations during the development of the system.","tags":["Augmented reality","Finger force training","Gamification","Pressing evaluation and training system"],"title":"Integration of Augmented Reality with Pressing Evaluation and Training System for Finger Force Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiraku Nakamura","Tatsuya Sonobe","Hiroyuki Toda","Naomi Fujisawa","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"a8f7f4f34d418bd3aec2a9f3b2cdcf5b","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/nakamura-robust-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.863112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakamura-robust-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Robust Positioning Method for Berthing Support Using Fusion of Tightly Coupled GNSS Carrier Phase with IMU and Visual Odometry.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Klen Čopič Pucihar","Christian Sandor","Matjaž Kljun","Wolfgang Huerst","Alexander Plopski","Takafumi Taketomi","Hirokazu Kato","Luis A.

A review of related work reveals that current approaches fail due to limited detection fidelity and spatial resolution. Our proposal, based on Google Soli’s radar sensing technology, is designed to detect micro-gestures on objects with sub-millimeter precision. Preliminary results with a custom gesture set show that Soli’s core features and traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) do not lead to robust recognition accuracy, and so more advanced techniques should be used instead, possibly incorporating additional sensor features.","tags":null,"title":"The Missing Interface: Micro-Gestures on Augmented Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Akiyama","Goshiro Yamamoto","Toshiyuki Amano","Takafumi Taketomi","Alexander Plopski","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"1f671513f305cba57074a42bddb6bf59","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/akiyama-perceptual-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T09:12:39.862186Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akiyama-perceptual-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Using projection mapping, we can control the appearance of realworld objects by projecting colored light onto them. Since a projector can only add illumination to the scene, limited color gamut can be presented through projection mapping. However, actual color and perceived color are not always the same, and there is often large difference between them. We intentionally generate this difference by inducing visual illusion for extending the controllable color gamut of a projector. In particular, we induce color constancy. We demonstrate changing object color with and without inducing color constancy. Audiences perceive the controlled colors with and without illusion as different color nevertheless these colors are physically completely same.","tags":["Cameras","Color","color constancy","colored

aging is an inevitable social problem in many developed countries. In order to manage this issue, it is necessary to drastically change the welfare security and labor system of relevant societies. We have proposed ``mosaic-type work'' in which a single ``virtual worker'' is synthesized based on individual workers and seniors through seamless information sharing. In this paper, we specifically focus on the spatial part of the mosaic, namely, the ``spatial mosaic,'' for enabling seniors to work without the burden of movement. Towards the actualization of this concept, we aimed to develop senior-friendly mobile avatar robots that can fit into seniors' daily lives. First, we analyzed problems of seniors' telecommunication with telepresence robots, and two elemental interfaces, the ``physically operable interface'' and the ``acoustic zooming interface.'' The former is a senior-friendly interface that the seniors can manipulate with their motion, and the latter enables the user to listen to sounds in a specified area that the user can adjust. In order to discuss integrated interface designs, we conducted two exploratory experiments to evaluate the performance of these systems.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Use of a Remote Movable Avatar Robot with an Immersive Interface for Seniors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Julier","Robert W.

Conventional telepresence research have focused on the exact re-creation of face-to-face communication at a fixed position in a specialized room, so there have been much less research on a life-sized mobile telepresence system despite many off-the-shelf mobile telepresence robots available. We propose various scalable holographic displays to visualize a life-sized avatar in an actual life. In addition, we introduce architecture to control embodied avatar according to user's intention by extending popular architecture for a multimodal virtual human, namely SAIBA. Our primitive prototype system was tested with 5 simple avatar animations to embody with a wheeled platform robot and a life-sized transparent holographic display and proved realistic avatar's movement complying user's intention and the situation at the remote location of avatar.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Mobile Embodied 3D Avatar as Telepresence Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Weir","Christian Sandor","Matt Swoboda","Thanh Nguyen","Ulrich Eck","Gerhard Reitmayr","Arindam Dey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"53556876e412772d84737bbc641b28d4","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/weir-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.199409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weir-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"BurnAR: Feel the Heat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Csongei","Liem Hoang","Ulrich Eck","Christian Sandor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"059305560f2275fd248d3db702bdf615","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/csongei-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.168494Z","relpermalink":"/publication/csongei-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ClonAR: Rapid Redesign of Real-World Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alvaro Cassinelli","Jussi Angesleva","Yoshihiro Watanabe","Gonzalo Frasca","Masatoshi Ishikawa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"9dc3ede87583a5983d94b3cbb0cf4619","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/cassinelli-skin-2012/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T09:26:17.135701Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cassinelli-skin-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Skin Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arindam Dey","Graeme Jarvis","Christian Sandor","Gerhard Reitmayr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"85ecb93b935bb0bd4465bbcc80f36599","permalink":"https://ar-lab.org/publication/dey-12-ismar/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T16:55:31.140643Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dey-12-ismar/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tablet versus Phone: Depth Perception in Handheld Augmented Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Patrick Maier","Arindam Dey","Christian A.
