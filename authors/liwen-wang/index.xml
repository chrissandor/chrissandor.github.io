      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Empirical Study about Size-Weight Illusion in Augmented Reality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Ph.D. research investigates how AR can modify the perceived weight of objects by changing visual features (size, texture, brightness, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these, the most deeply explored phenomenon is the size-weight illusion (SWI): smaller objects are perceived as heavier. Although other researchers have investigated this effect in AR, I plan to fill a gap conducted psychophysical experiments to determine Point of Subjective Equality(PSE) using AR stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through AR, researchers can do more powerful experiments, which also become useful as inspiration for other researchers. Moreover, AR also could create implications for humanity such as Superman&amp;rsquo;s x-ray vision or reconstructed Utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If AR has a chance to turn imagination into reality, measuring perception level would become an essential indicator of how AR integrates into human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly, Psychologist/Psychophysicist could benefit from our result. They could choose whether to use AR starting their psychophysics experiment. In daily life, ‘feel lighter’ could augment endurance while handling objects.&lt;/p&gt;
